            <h1>Our Disapearing Wetlands</h1>
            <div class="video"></div>
            <p>CMAC Youth Voices is a documentary filmmaking program. We were given the freedom of choosing our own stories of personal or societal significance, which I chose to film about the disappearance of Californiaâ€™s wetlands. Creating a film was challenging, I had no experience in filming or video editing. Thankfully the mentors of the Youth Voices program were always available to help and taught us the basics of documentary filmmaking. In the process I learned how to interview others, creating a voiceover, editing footage and sound to look the best way possible. Along with how to use software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. From this opportunity I was able to learn how to harness the power of media to tell stories.</p>
