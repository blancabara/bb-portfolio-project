            <p>Participating in the Western Access Video Excellence (WAVE) Awards is one of my greatest accomplishments. The WAVE Awards program is a competition of community media. Earlier this year, I created a documentary film with Community Media Access Collaborative (CMAC). With the help of CMAC staff my documentary, Our Disappearing Wetlands, was able to be submitted into the competition and was awarded as the top video in the Community Issues student division. I have also achieved a Coursera certificate from completing the online course, Programming with JavaScript. I learned the basic concepts of JavaScript such as working with functions, arrays, variables, data types, and much more. Completing such an engaging course was incredibly rewarding with knowledge.</p>

                <p>My favorite things to do are always hands-on. Drawing has been the way I express myself for my entire life. I’ve experimented with different mediums and I hope to continue learning more. My favorite medium of drawing is pixel art, the texture that pixels present is very satisfying to me. It is somewhat restricting since all shapes are pixels but by doing so it allows me to experiment more with how colors work together. Ceramics is another hobby of mine which is still new to me but I have improved my work over the past months. Working with clay can be quite a challenging mess, but continuing to try and make what I want is what makes it fun.</p>

                <div class="img"></div>
                <p>I plan on attending college to pursue a bachelor's degree in game design. Doing my first two years of college at Fresno City college and then transferring to CSU East Bay is the best route I have in mind. Especially since I am already familiar with the college campus and have reviewed the courses they each have available. After graduating, working independently is something I would love to try before becoming part of a company to give myself more time to figure out what other skills I can improve or develop.</p>
