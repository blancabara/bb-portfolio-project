            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p>Having only a year of coding experience has brought me on a ride of ups and downs. Through the tough challenges and hours of coding, it has brought me better skills. I am very proud of my work and hope to continue improving what I can make.</p>

            <h1>Writing</h1>
            <p>Programming is not the only skill set I have. Writing goes hand in hand with the world of programming since it develops your use of words and thought process.</p>

            <p>Besides school work, I have been part of a documentary filmmaking program. Filmmaking was new to me but I came into it looking for a new outlet of self expression. Over the course of twelve weeks we were taught many filmmaking techniques and skills. If ever given the opportunity I would love to be part of a filmmaking project again.</p>
