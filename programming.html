            <!-- hover open -->
            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>With a heartful of persistence and communication the creation of BattleWitch was fulfilled. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this project focus was to create a board game into a web version with our own twist. Visual Studio Code is the main software I used to code this project, alongside Github. With BattleWitch, my partner and I were able to learn the use of JavaScript functions and further develop our problem solving skills. Challenges were not new to us since we faced a variety of them on our path. Although we had issues ranging from simple misspellings on our code to bugs and crashes, we were able to work through them all to complete a functioning BattleWitch.</p>

            <h1>Social Widget Challenge</h1>
            <!-- hover open -->
            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>The goal of this challenge was to create a social widget. We were given an example of such and we needed to create something similar but with our own touch ups. Already having experience with CSS, HTML and some JavaScript made this challenge much smoother since I was able to play around more with what code I enjoyed writing and what I did not. Being able to reflect on my code lead to a result I am proud of.</p>

            <h1>Budget Calculator</h1>
            <!-- hover open -->
            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>Budget Calculator is another project revolving mainly around the use of JavaScript. Our task was to complete a function for users to calculate deductions, house payments and balance their checkbooks. Visual Studio Code and Github were used to create the Budget Calculator website. As this was my first project using JavaScript it was indeed a difficult task but help from peers and JavaScript courses made this much easier. Collaborating with others is always a resource I can use which is incredibly useful.</p>

            <h1>Energy Consumption</h1>
            <!-- hover open -->
            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>Using only CSS and HTML our prompt was to create a series of informational pages about a social issue of our choice. However, this project was different from all the others since we were not allowed to code it ourselves; we only had control of managing what our peers code for us. Getting used to the role of leader was quite a challenge, but after a couple of tries with different partners, it became easy to lead and advise them. Collaboration was used a great deal for this project; therefore, I expanded my communication skills by working with others.</p>
