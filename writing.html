            <h1>Career Choice Essay</h1>

            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>Conducting research and reporting information about Web Development as a career was fairly interesting. With the Career Choice Essay I was able to learn how to dig for information using multiple websites such as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and ONet OnLine. This essay was very successful to me since I thoroughly enjoyed being able to investigate information and expand my knowledge on Web Development since it is a career I am interested in for the future.

            <h1>The Machine Stops: Real Estate Description</h1>
            <!-- hover open -->
            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>The Machine Stops: Real Estate Description was a great form of practicing the use of descriptive words. By including more details it improves the quality of the description for selling living spaces from “The Machine Stops”. I was given the task to “sell” the complete experience of the living environment while still keeping the description honest in nature. This writing sample is able to perfectly capture the importance of depictive details, especially in the process of promoting an object or service.
