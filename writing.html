            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>Conduction research and reporting information about Web Development as a career was fairly interesting. I was able to learn how to dig for information using multiple websites such as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and ONet OnLine. This essay was very successful to me since I thoroughly enjoyed being able to investigate information and expand my knowledge on Web Development since it is a career I am interested in for the future.

            <h1>DelveHomes Reflective Essay</h1>
            <!-- hover open -->
            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>This is a reflection of the process from my first major coding project, DelveHomes. From start to finish it includes everything from analyzing competitors to the final presentation of the project. Summarizing the entirety of the DelveHomes project process was interesting as it was full of multiple ups and downs. Looking back on this project makes me realize how much Iâ€™ve improved my coding skills and I am thankful for my determination.
